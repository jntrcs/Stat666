Projects for Stat 666-Multivariate Methods

Mini project 1 involves identifying outliers (potentially fraudulent transactions) among 250,000 transactions. 
The variables are the first 20 principle components of the original dataset. Additionally, we were asked to assess
multivariate normality of the data and transform it if possible.
